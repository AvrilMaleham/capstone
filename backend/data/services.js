        "Just like people, over time, businesses develop their own traits and personalities, as well as strengths and weaknesses. And just like people, organisations can be healthy or unhealthy, and anywhere in between. Just as people need exercise, sleep, healthy food, and a network around them to achieve success, balance and optimal function, so too do businesses need similar structures and practices to generate the platform for optimum performance, and powerful long term financial success. This is why and where a business health check becomes vitally important.  To create long term success in our businesses we need to check in with where we are at. At Edify, our business health check, or audits, are a little different. We not only review the business’s individual moving parts, we take an informed, professional and holistic look at the business as a whole. We can then establish the best plan to move you forward with your short, medium and long term business goals.",
