              Erin's knowledge of the property management industry was
              impressive, and she was able to provide insights and
              recommendations that we had not previously considered. Her ability
              to think outside the box and provide creative solutions to our
              challenges was truly remarkable. Erin's guidance and support
              helped us to streamline our processes, improve our communication
              with tenants, and ultimately increase our bottom line.

              The property management checklists that I purchased from Edify
              were comprehensive, easy to use, and incredibly helpful. They
              provided step-by-step guidance for everything from tenant
              screening to move-out inspections, which made managing our
              properties much easier and more efficient. The checklists were
              well-organized and included all the necessary details, making it
              easy for us to stay on top of all our tasks and responsibilities.
